**ConfigMaps** are a [built-in resource type](overview.md) in Kubernetes. They **store non-confidential data in key-value pairs**.

Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.

With ConfigMaps you can decouple environment-specific configuration from your container images, so that your applications are easily portable between environments (e.g. production and staging).

> [!WARNING]
> **ConfigMaps do not provide secrecy or encryption.** If you need to store confidential/secret data, use a [Secret](secrets.md) instead.

*Additional notes:*

* A ConfigMap is not designed to hold large chunks of data. The data stored in a ConfigMap cannot exceed 1 MiB.
* Multiple Pods can reference the same ConfigMap.

## Resource YAML

There are two primary styles how to define a ConfigMap.

**Property-like keys:**

```yaml {hl_lines="6-8"}
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: property-like-keys
data:
  NAME: MyApp
  VERSION: 1.2.3
  AUTHOR: Me
```

Here each key (`NAME`, `VERSION`, `AUTHOR`) maps to a simple value.

**File-like keys:**

``` {hl_lines="6-12"}
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: file-like-keys
data:
  game.properties: |
    enemy.types=aliens,monsters
    player.maximum-lives=5
  user-interface.properties: |
    color.good=purple
    color.bad=yellow
    allow.textmode=true
```

Here, each key (`game.properties`, `user-interface.properties`) maps to a multi-line string (think: file contents).

The **property-like** style is mainly used, if the container uses environment variables or command-line arguments for configuration.

The **file-like** style is mainly used, if the container uses config files for configuration.

If needed, you can also mix both styles inside the same ConfigMap (see [an example](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/#configmaps-and-pods)).

> [!NOTE]
> **Kubernetes does not parse the values** inside a ConfigMap. It especially doesn't interpret the values of file-like keys. It only handles/interprets the keys. (This becomes clear when we look at how ConfigMaps are used in Pods below.)

## Using ConfigMaps

There are three ways to consume a ConfigMap:

* **Environment variables**  -- The container is configured via environment variables.
* **Files**                  -- The container is configured via config files.
* **Command-line arguments** -- The container is configured via command-line arguments.

### As Environment Variables {#using-env}

The simplest way to use a ConfigMap as environment variables is like this - via `.spec.containers.envFrom`:

```yaml {hl_lines="9-11"}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-example
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.26.0
      envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: my-config-map
```

This will simply **map every key from `my-config-map`** to an environment variable.

> [!TIP]
> It's recommended to use **property-like keys** for environment variables.
>
> You *could* use file-like keys but they almost always contain line breaks - and when the values contain line breaks, things will get weird.

You can also **select only certain keys** from the ConfigMap (and even rename them) - via `.spec.containers.env.valueFrom`:

```yaml {hl_lines="9-15"}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-example
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.26.0
      env:
        - name: PLAYER_INITIAL_LIVES # Notice that the case is different here
                                     # from the key name in the ConfigMap.
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: my-config-map       # The ConfigMap this value comes from.
              key: player_initial_lives # The key to fetch.
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the ConfigMap while the consuming Pod is running, **changes will *not* propagate into the Pod**. You need to restart the Pod to get the updated values.

### As Files {#using-volume}

For this, you first define a volume with the config map as source (lines 14-17) and then map this volume into the container (lines 9-12):

```yaml {lineNos=true,hl_lines="9-12,14-17"}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-example
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.26.0
      volumeMounts:
        - name: config
          mountPath: /config
          readOnly: true
  # You define volumes at the Pod level, then mount them into containers inside that Pod.
  volumes:
    - name: config
      configMap:
        name: my-config-map
```

This will **mount every key as a file** with with its value as content - under the directory `/config` inside the `nginx` container.

> [!TIP]
> It's recommended to use **file-like keys** for this - but property-like keys work fine as well (the files will just have one line).

You can also **select only certain keys** from the ConfigMap - but you have to define their path/filename in this case:

```yaml {lineNos=true,hl_lines="11-15"}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-example
spec:
  ...
  volumes:
    - name: config
      configMap:
        name: my-config-map
        items:
          - key: "game.properties"  # key from ConfigMap
            path: "game.properties"  # file name on "disk"
          - key: "user-interface.properties"
            path: "user-interface.properties"
```

> [!TIP]
> Unlike with environment variables, **changes to the ConfigMap will propagate into the Pod** while the Pod is running.
>
> However, there is a "significant" delay before the files are updated. This **delay is up to 1 minute** - defined by the [Kubelet's `syncFrequency` setting](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/#kubelet-config-k8s-io-v1beta1-KubeletConfiguration).

### As Command-Line Arguments {#using-cli-args}

To use a ConfigMap for command-line arguments, you **first need to map the ConfigMap [as environment variables](#using-env)**. You can then reference these environment variables in the containers `command` or `args` field.

**Command** and shell expands `LOG_LEVEL`:

```yaml {lineNos=true,hl_lines="4,6,17,20"}
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: configmap-example
data:
  LOG_LEVEL: Error
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-command-example
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  containers:
    - name: myapp
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Starting with log level $LOG_LEVEL"]
      envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: configmap-example
```

**Args** and Kubernetes expands `LOG_LEVEL`:

```yaml {lineNos=true,hl_lines="4,6,18,21"}
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: configmap-example
data:
  LOG_LEVEL: Error
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-command-example
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  containers:
    - name: myapp
      image: busybox
      command: ["echo"]
      args: ["Starting with log level $(LOG_LEVEL)"]
      envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: configmap-example
```
